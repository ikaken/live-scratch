# Live Scratch

[日本語](README_ja.md)

A tool for bi-directional live sync between `workspace/` files and the Scratch editor in your browser. Edit sb3 project files in a text editor and see changes reflected instantly — or make changes in the Scratch editor and have them written back to `workspace/` automatically.

## Scratch x Vibe Coding

![Demo](demo.gif)

live-scratch exposes `workspace/project.json` as plain JSON. This means **you can edit Scratch projects directly with AI coding agents.**

Simply give natural-language instructions like "change the cat to a dog" or "add a game over screen" to terminal AI agents such as [Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code), [Codex](https://github.com/openai/codex), or [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli), and watch your Scratch project update in real time.

```
You: "Change the cat to a dog"
  ↓ AI edits workspace/project.json
  ↓ live-scratch detects the change
  ↓ Scratch editor in the browser updates instantly
You: See the result and give the next instruction
```

Instead of dragging blocks by hand, program Scratch through conversation. See the results in real time in your browser.

## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/champierre/live-scratch.git
cd live-scratch
npm install
```

`npm install` automatically performs the following after installing dependencies:

1. Clones [scratch-editor](https://github.com/scratchfoundation/scratch-editor) at a pinned version (`81d16ac24`)
2. Applies patches to expose `window.vm` and fix TypeScript type declarations
3. Runs `npm install` and builds `scratch-gui`

## Usage

```bash
npm start
```

1. A default project (Scratch's initial state) is extracted into `workspace/`
2. Your browser automatically opens the Scratch editor
3. Edit and save `workspace/project.json` or asset files with your text editor
4. Changes are instantly reflected in the Scratch editor in the browser
5. Changes made in the Scratch editor (adding blocks, sprites, costumes, sounds, etc.) are automatically saved back to `workspace/`

A circular indicator in the top-right corner shows the connection status (green = connected, red = disconnected).

To start from an existing sb3 file:

```bash
npm start -- myproject.sb3
```

To change the port, use the `--port` option:

```bash
npm start -- --port 8080
```

## Architecture

```
[Text Editor] → edit → [workspace/project.json + assets]
                                ↕ bi-directional sync
                        [Node.js Server]
                        (Express + WebSocket + chokidar)
                                ↕ WebSocket (ArrayBuffer)
                        [Browser: Scratch GUI + live-reload.js]
                                ↕ vm.loadProject / vm.saveProjectSb3
                        [Scratch editor]
```

- **workspace → browser**: chokidar watches file changes, builds sb3, and sends it via WebSocket
- **browser → workspace**: listens for `PROJECT_CHANGED` events, debounces (1s), sends sb3 back to server, which extracts it to `workspace/`
- **Loop prevention**: both client and server use ignore flags with timeouts to prevent infinite sync loops
- **Multi-tab support**: changes from one client are broadcast to all other connected clients

## Notes

- If `project.json` has a JSON syntax error, an error is displayed in the terminal and the update is skipped
- `vm.loadProject()` reloads the entire project, so running scripts, runtime variable values, and clones are reset
